## OSM tag mapping

### Way properties

Way properties set a way's permission and optionally influences its walk and bicycle safety factors.
These factors determine how desirable an OSM way is when routing for cyclists and pedestrians.

### Bicycle and walking safety mixins

Mixins are selectors that have only an effect on the bicycle and walk safety factors but not on the
permission of an OSM way. Multiple mixins can apply to the same way and their effects compound.
